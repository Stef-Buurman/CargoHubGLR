# CargoHub REST API

This repository contains the development of a Warehouse Management System (WMS) for CargoHub, a company specializing in the handling and storage of goods.

## Background

CargoHub previously used a custom-built software solution for processing data and managing critical process flows via an API. However, the software lacks essential components such as documentation, tests, and repositories, making further development challenging. Additionally, the original development company is no longer active, leaving us with the responsibility to map, document, and enhance the software.
